Cyberlions is a scholar led program that offers education in Technology and Robotics. This includes porgramming, documentation and self-leadership. Our goal is to teach young scholars to run this club as a self-sutaining business that can overcome any obstacle they face.

Currently Cyberlions operates using the [C17 Coding Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C17_(C_standard_revision)). Arrangements have been made to convert Cyberlions to a dual coding platform. Contenders include Python and C++.
