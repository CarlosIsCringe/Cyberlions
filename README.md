Cyberlions is a scholar run club that offers education and learning in the field of technology and robotics. This includes multiple subjects such as engineering, scripting, documentation and self-leadership. Our aim is to have our scholars run this programs as a self-maintaining business rather than a teacher/mentor led club.
